## Problem Statement

[problem-statement]: #problem-statement

Linkerd implements an identity system for meshed communication. This system builds on Kubernetes'
`ServiceAccount`s, which manage per-workload authentication tokens for the Kubernetes API.
Linkerd uses these credentials to bootstrap and validate TLS certificates that can be used to
provide mutually-validated TLS (mTLS) connections between meshed endpoints. This mutual
validation will serve as the basis for auditing and policy functionality.

Today, mTLS is only applied on HTTP connections. This RFC will provide a plan to provide
ubiquitous, automatic, transparent mTLS for all meshed traffic, regardless of protocol.

### Goals

1. All meshed traffic is private;
2. All meshed traffic is associated with Linkerd identities;
3. Provide diagnostic tools to inspect the mTLS status of connections.

#### Non-goals

* Implement authorization policies
* Provide auditability guarantees
