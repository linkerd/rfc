# Summary

[summary]: #summary

The Linkerd project needs a formal process to understand and communicate upcoming changes to Linkerd, as well as shepherd contributions from the community into the project.

The purpose of the RFC process is to reduce the amount of "tribal knowledge" in our community. By moving decisions into a well tracked artifact, this process aims to enhance communication and discoverability.

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

This work will make it clear to contributors how to get their contributions into Linkerd and the status of that work at any point in the process. It also enables the Linkerd maintainers to understand the progression of work coming into the project, it's status and whether it's waiting on their involvement.

# Reference-level explanation

We will be using [the RFC repository](https://github.com/linkerd/rfc) to store active and archived RFC's and the review / acceptence process through pull requests.

# Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Github is a more difficult medium for conversation than Google Doc, but it does centralize the process.

# Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

Previously this work was all managed via Github issues in projects boards, with Google docs used to do planning and discussion.

Inspiration from:

* [The Rust RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)
* [The Python PEP process](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/)
* [The Kubernetes KEP process](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps)

# Unresolved questions

* As much of this was adapted from the Rust RFC process, I removed RFC #'s, because I wasn't clear on the utility, but that could be re-introduced if needed.

# Future possibilities

This is a starting place and can/should be ammended if there are obvious improvements.
